# Sea-Turtle-face-recognition
## Overview
This project is a classification model that is trained to recognize turtles. The dataset used for training and testing is composed of 1118 images of turtles. The model used in this project is the SwinTransformer which is a variation of the transformer architecture. The dataset is divided into 99 classes, each class representing a different turtle.
## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 49% on the test data and 100% on the training data. However, due to the limited size of the dataset, more work is needed to improve the performance of the model.
## Notes
Please be aware that the dataset used in this project is not publicly available and you will need to create your own dataset to run the model.
Make sure to run the code on GPU as the model is very large.
Training the model on a larger dataset will likely improve the accuracy.
Hyperparameter tuning may also improve the model's performance.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of the SwinTransformer for turtle classification. While the results were limited due to the small size of the dataset, the model has the potential to achieve better performance with a larger dataset and fine-tuning.
